smallchange is an application that connects a community of recyclers with corporate sponsors and charities.

The app incentivizes users to be dilligent about recycling, by rewarding them with small micropayments each time they do it. The micropayments are funded by corporate sponsors, who benefit with some advertising in the application and a connection to like-minded consumers.
